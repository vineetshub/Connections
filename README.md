My project, Connections Reimagined, is a web-based puzzle game that draws inspiration from the New York Times' Connections, reimagined for today's audience. I've designed it to challenge players cognitively while exploring various themes, from the wonders of space to the intricacies of Shakespeare's literature. The game encourages players to match words with hidden themes, promoting critical thinking and broadening knowledge across different subjects. Developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project showcases the potential of modern web development tools to create interactive, educational, and visually appealing experiences. My next step for this project is to incorporate AI implementation into the gameplay. This addition aims to enhance the puzzle-solving experience, making it more dynamic and interactive by adapting to the player's skill level and preferences, ultimately creating a more personalized and challenging game environment.
