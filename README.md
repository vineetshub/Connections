Connections Reimagined is a web-based puzzle game inspired by the New York Times' Connections, offering a blend of thematic exploration and cognitive challenge. This overhaul isn't just a tribute; it's designed for modern players with its intuitive gameplay, vibrant interface, and diverse themes.

Players match words to hidden themes, ranging from celestial bodies to Shakespeare's works, encouraging critical thinking and knowledge across various domains. Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the project demonstrates the capabilities of modern web development to create engaging and educational experiences.
